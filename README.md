# Title: Analysis carbon dioxide emissions in the UK

## Abstract 
Carbon dioxide is one of the main contributors to global warming and air pollution. The UK is one of the largest sources of carbon emissions and is also under severe pressure to reduce CO2 emissions. Therefore, my study aims to provide further insights for predicting and reducing CO2 emissions in the UK. Specifically, the study will use simple linear regression to calculate the relationships between the five independent variables (GDP, population, urbanization, BEV and REC) and CO2 (dependent variable). In addition, the study uses k-means clustering to cluster different inner-London boroughs by CO2 intensity. The result show that all five independent variables (BEV, GDP, urbanization, REC and population) are highly correlated with UK CO2 emissions. However, the correlation of the linear model is significantly reduced when we apply the difference form of these variables. Finally, the cluster analysis found Westminster and the city of London with higher carbon-efficient economy while Bexley, Enfield and Hillingdon had the opposite pattern.

## Research Question
Overall, my study aims to provide further insights and grounds for predicting and reducing CO2 emissions in the UK. 

- First, I would use the five independent variables (GDP, population, urbanization, BEVs and REC) that were mentioned above, searching out answers to the research question: "Is there a significant correlation between the five independent variables and CO2 emissions in the UK?". 

- Then, I would choose London as an example which is the capital city in the UK, pointing out the higher carbon-efficient economy areas (showing low CO2 emissions and high economic contribution) and lower performance areas with high environmental costs.
